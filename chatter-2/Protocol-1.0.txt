Listing server. These requests are made using HTTP/1.1(will be upgraded to HTTPS later), following a RESTful API model.

Whenever a new server is started

	Server -> Listing: 	POST request sent to the URL: api.listingserver.com/servers/server-id
	Listing -> Server: 	Content body is the authorization key to use when updating info about the server. Status 201 if successful, status 400 if the listing server was unable to ping the target server, or if the server name did not match required formats

When a server shuts down

	Server -> Listing:	DELETE request to URL: api.listingserver.com/servers/server-id, authorization key specified as "C2Listing <key>" in Authorization header
	Listing -> Server:	Empty content body, status 200 if successfully deleted, status 400 if the server is not in the listing, status 401 if authorization token cannot be used for this server/is invalid

Retrieves all of the current servers and their data

	Server -> Listing: GET request to api.listingserver.com/servers
	Listing -> Server: Content body with JSON: { servers: [ ... ]}. Each individual server is modeled as: { id: 0, displayName: "display name", address: "127.0.0.1:5000" }

When a server wants to update information

	Server -> Listing: PUT request to api.listingserver.com/servers/server-id with content body of all the properties that should be set. Properties that are not specified will not be updated. Authorization key must be provided for this server
	Listing -> Server: Empty content body. Status 200 if successfully updated, status 401 if authorization token is invalid, status 400 if the information is invalid, whether that be the key or the value.

		connectedUsers: Number (default: 0)
		maxUsers: Number (default: 50)
